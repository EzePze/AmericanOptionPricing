# GDAHackathon

The programming challenge
Optimization problems for either C++ or Python code to be interfaced with our open crypto data initiative framework
Implement OUCH Server using C++ or Python to accept Order Entry messages and respond back with appropriate response messages.  Application should build the order book and print it on the console every 1 second. After completing this, modify the application to run it in silent mode and price the order book after receiving signal (USER1) from the operating system.

SoupTCP validation for OUCH login is not required to be implemented for this challenge 


Financial engineering
Numerical Solutions Of American Options With Dividends Using
Finite Difference Methods, using Python or C.

Extreme programming
Comparative analysis of FIX 4.4 message parsing using TCP Stack vs Kernel Bypass using QuickFix https://github.com/quickfix/quickfix
Create a FIX Acceptor to receive 1 million FIX messages, benchmark roundtrip latency
Simulate the above using Kernel Bypass and benchmark the roundtrip latency, donâ€™t use TCP stack, rather read the messages from eth interface use pcap library to get the layer2 frames to parse the messages(use tcpdump command to dump the traffic on eth interface)

The machine learning challenge
Implementing machine learning techniques to solve a computer vision problem for technical analysis, similar to our own ACPRI tool.
